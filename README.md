## **telegram-takeout** 
A simple python script that extracts telegram chats

Still in development...


## How it works
The script uses the [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) Telegram API client to parse all chats and messages and storing them in separate HTML files.

## Features
Currently it parses all chats and stores the messages in a HTML file and all the media associated with it.
